# App-Dev
My first repository

My favorite movie is 'How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days'. I like the rom-com genre; I enjoy watching them. At first, I thought it was a cringe movie until I realized I was at the end of the movie. And as for series, my favorite is 'The Walking Dead'. It is fiction and will always be my favorite series of all time, no matter how long it is. I like how negan, being antagonist, become protagoist.
